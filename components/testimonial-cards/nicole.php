            <p>paul consistently impresses me with his dedication to his craft. not only is he highly talented with a
                <strong>keen eye for design</strong>, but he also writes clean, innovative code that perfectly
                complements his <strong>user-centered</strong> ui. having paul on your team is a true asset—he’s reliable and manages his
                time so effectively that he consistently delivers strong, well-thought-out projects.
